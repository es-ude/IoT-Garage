## Auto Tool  

This can be used to orientate and support the model automatically.
In some cases the auto orientation might orientate the model in a way that the supports will be in the detail. Generally detail should be on the top of the orientated model. If not rotate the model manually.

## Orientation  

Generally a model should be orientated in a way that minimizes paralell surfaces to the build plate
