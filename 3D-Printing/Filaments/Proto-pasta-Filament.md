## Printing with Proto-pasta

For some more heat resistant prints use the HTPLA from Proto Pasta. After printing it has to go into the oven at 100 degrees for about yyy minutes. Unfortunately, there is no Ultimaker Filament, that supports a heat resistance for up to 160 degrees. The loading process is the same as with the Ultimaker Filament, but since only the official filament is recognizable via RFID, we have to adjust the settings by ourselves.

Chosen Print Settings:
Default Printing Temperature: 210 degrees  
Default Build Plate Temperature: 60 degrees
Retraction Distance: 6,5mm
Retraction Speed: 25mm/s
Standby Temperature: 175 degrees
Fan Speed: 100%

This Custom Print Settings are also saved and applied automatically when the desired material is selected.

First, select the material under Material -> Proto Plasta -> HTPLA -> Matte Fibre HTPLA and confirm. The rest is the usual printing process.

### Troubleshooting
if the file wasn't sent to the printer, it is stuck. In that case go to the "Monitor"-Section in Ultimaker 4, and confirm the notification for the changed Filament.
