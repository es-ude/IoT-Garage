General Rules for being in the IoT Garage:

Leave your place as you found it, this includes: 
- put the vise in the middle of the desk 
- put all things from the drawer back in it
- switch off lamp and ventilation
- put the trash in the bin
- arrange the stuff at the table like it was before
- put all tools back to their actual place

If you use some hardware stuff (LEDs, resistors, ...) and you take one of the last things, please let us know for ordering new stuff.

After using the 3D-Printer please clean the glass plate.  

No eating and drinking allowed.
